<p style="text-align: center;"> Welcome to Pantha, a moderation, fun, utility and **completely open source** discord bot for your server! <br>
  Emojis for the bot can be found at <a href="https://discord.gg/thejedi"> this link </a>. </p>

## Why do I self-host this bot?

Why Pantha? We have these features: (and over **100** commands in total)

📑 **Info:** `p.ping`, `p.snipe`, `p.wi` and **7** more informational commands. <br>
🎈 **Fun:** `p.randomfact`, `p.beer`, `p.rps`, `p.truthordare` and **10** more fun commands.  <br> 
⚙️ **Error Handling:** full fleged error handling for the bot, a big bot, big error handling. <br>
🛡️ **Anti-Spam Protection:** The bot doesn't join servers with below 50 members as many tasks are running for each server that the bot is in, thus to reduce the pressure on our hosting we don't like joining random servers.  <br> 
👑 **Owner:** `p.load`, `p.unload`, `p.cleartickets`, `p.toggle`: Disabling/enabling commands and **5+** more owner restricted commands. <br> 
📝 **Patch Notes:** Using the bot to post it's own updates? <br>
🔨 **Moderation** `p.slowmode`, `p.lock`, `p.unlock`, `p.kick`, `p.ban` and **5** more foolproof moderation commands. <br> 
🐸 **Dank Memer Assistant:** A perfect assistant for Dank Memer: banning people who leave your server after a giveaway/heist event, showing the rules of the bot.  <br> 
🎉 **Giveaways:** Giveaways for your discord server (with buttons). <br> 
⭐ **Utilities:** `p.poll`, `p.choose`, `p.embed`, `p.coinflip` and **5** more utility commands. <br>
📫 **Suggestions:** Users can suggest what they want to you.  <br>
